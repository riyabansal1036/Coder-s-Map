      Rajasthan is located on the northwestern side of India, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar
      Desert (also known as the Great Indian Desert) and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the
      northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. It is bordered by five other Indian states:
      Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to
      the southwest. Its geographical location is 23.3 to 30.12 North latitude and 69.30 to 78.17 East longitude, with
      the Tropic of Cancer passing through the southernmost tip of the state.

      Major features include the ruins of the Indus Valley Civilisation at Kalibangan and Balathal, the Dilwara Temples,
      a Jain pilgrimage site at Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, in the ancient Aravalli mountain range and in
      eastern Rajasthan, the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, a World Heritage Site[12] known for its bird life.
      Rajasthan is also home to three national tiger reserves, the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur, Sariska
      Tiger Reserve in Alwar and the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota.

      The geographic features of Rajasthan are the Thar Desert and the Aravalli Range, which runs through the state from
      southwest to northeast, almost from one end to the other, for more than 850 kilometres (530 mi). Mount Abu lies at
      the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the West Banas River, although a series of
      broken ridges continues into Haryana in the direction of Delhi where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the
      Raisina Hill and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis,
      leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.


      Mount Abu.
      The Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak Guru Shikhar (Mount Abu), which is 1,722 metres
      (5,650 ft) in height, to Khetri in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the
      range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves
      gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the
      east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350 m above sea
      level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar.
